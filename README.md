This application provides a user-friendly interface for managing a grocery list, allowing users to add, edit, and remove items from the list with ease. The application also features an alert system to notify users of successful or unsuccessful operations.

React hooks are used to manage the state of the application, and localStorage is used to persist the data between sessions. The code also includes utility functions to handle features such as adding, editing, and removing items from the list, as well as displaying alerts to the user.
